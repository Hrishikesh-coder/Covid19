    <h3 style='padding-left:20px;padding-top:20px;'>WHAT IS COVID-19 ?</h3>
    <p style='padding-left:10px;padding-top:25px;font-weight:bold;'>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
         The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic.
         As of 24 April 2020, more than 2.79 million cases have been reported across 185 countries and territories, resulting in more than 195,000 deaths. More than 781,000 people have recovered.</p>
         <h3 style='padding-left:20px;padding-top:20px;'>WHAT CAUSES COVID-19 ?</h3>
         <p style='padding-left:10px;padding-top:25px;font-weight:bold;'>
            Some details about how the disease is spread are still being determined.
            The WHO and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say it is primarily spread during close contact and by small droplets produced when people cough, sneeze or talk;with close contact being within approximately 1–2 m (3–7 ft).
            Both sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads.
            Loud talking releases more droplets than normal talking.
            A study in Singapore found that an uncovered cough can lead to droplets travelling up to 4.5 metres (15 feet)

         <h3 style='padding-left:20px;padding-top:20px;'>WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 ?</h3>
         <p style='padding-left:10px;padding-top:25px;font-weight:bold;'>
            Fever is the most common symptom, although some older people and those with other health problems experience fever later in the disease.In one study, 44% of people had fever when they presented to the hospital, while 89% went on to develop fever at some point during their hospitalization.

            Other common symptoms include cough, loss of appetite, fatigue, shortness of breath, sputum production, and muscle and joint pains.Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in varying percentages.Less common symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat.
            
            More serious symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips. Immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.

         <h3 style='padding-left:20px;padding-top:20px;'>WHAT DO I DO IF I EXPERIENCE SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 ?</h3>
         <p style='padding-left:10px;padding-top:25px;font-weight:bold;'>
            Stay home. Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care. Do not leave your home, except to get medical care. Do not visit public areas.
            Take care of yourself. Get rest and stay hydrated.
            Stay in touch with your doctor. Call before you get medical care. Be sure to get care if you have trouble breathing, or have any other emergency warning signs, or if you think it is an emergency.
            Avoid public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxi
